### Known issues:
- Not yet signed with an Apple Developer certificate
- Truncated text may overlap in Safari and Firefox in macOS Sierra (10.12) and OS X El Capitan (10.11)
- When typing in a password input field in the OS, like iTunes account, there is no * sign appearing when typing a character. The password is typed completely and it is accepted, but password field appears blank before submission (Issue #2).

### Special Thanks:
- **[Alexander Schreiber](https://github.com/schreiberstein)** for creating the amazing origonal [LucidaGrandeYosemite](https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeyosemite) and [LucidaGrandeElCapitan](https://github.com/schreiberstein/lucidagrandeelcapitan). Without his origonal project and his great take on creating diff'ed font patches, this project wouldn't have been possible
- **[Randall Brown](https://github.com/blladnar)** for sharing some great sample code on embedding buttons in window frames - [NSWindowButtons](https://github.com/blladnar/NSWindowButtons). Without his sample code, the update button would have looked a lot more out-of-place
- **[Salvador Lopez](http://simiographics.deviantart.com/)** for sharing his amazing icon set - [Secure Icons](http://simiographics.deviantart.com/art/Secure-Icons-162217765) - for free (even for commercial use!).
